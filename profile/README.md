Ticket System is a public Discord bot designed to help users easily reach out to the server team. What makes it different from other ticket bots is that it uses threads instead of channels. This allows it to use unique features and mechanics that aren't possible in normal text channels.

<ul>
<li><b>📃 Eternal Transcripts:</b> Tickets aren't just deleted when they're closed. Instead, they are archived so that members can access them at any time, while preventing messages from being edited or deleted. No more lost conversations - every ticket remains accessible for future reference, right within Discord.</li>
<br>
<li><b>🌃 Beyond the limits:</b> While threads have many advantages, they also have some limitations. To address this, Ticket System provides toggleable features, such as preventing threads from disappearing after a period of inactivity, preventing users from adding other members by mentioning them and automatically closing tickets when the user leaves the server or thread.</li>
<br>
<li><b>🛡️ Full Privacy:</b> Unlike channels, if a someone doesn’t have permission to view a thread, it won’t even appear for them through the Discord gateway. This ensures complete privacy, preventing unauthorized users from detecting tickets using third-party client modifications or other tools.</li>
</ul>

Ticket System is currently in beta and being developed on a daily basis. If you want to report bugs, suggest features or contact me, feel free to join the <a href="https://discord.gg/4XZ6T2wen4">support server</a>.

<li><b>✨ There's more to come:</b> Ticket System is far from being finished. I'm currently working on features that are necessary for a ticket bot, such as fully customisable messages, support for multiple modules (including dropdowns), forms and much more. An online dashboard is also planned for the future.</li>
<br>
<li><b>💖 Made with Love:</b> This bot started as my first coding project and I'm doing it for fun, not for profit (and because I want a great ticket bot).  There are no premium plans or subscriptions - you get access to the whole bot and all its features for free. <i>If you'd still like to support me, you can do so via <a href="https://ko-fi.com/phoenix3000">Kofi</a>.</i></li>
